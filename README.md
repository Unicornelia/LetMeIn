## Reason for Creation

We had five days to create an application of the groups choice.

This application was created to solve the problem of leaving a bar at closing and not knowing of an open bar to go to next.  

## How to Run the Application

- $ git clone https://github.com/Unicornelia/LetMeIn
- $ brew install node
- $ npm start
- $ visit localhost:3000
